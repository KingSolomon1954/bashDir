set completion-ignore-case on
#       If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion
#       in a case-insensitive fashion.

set -o notify
#       If set, bash reports terminated background jobs immedi-
#       ately,  rather  than  waiting until before printing the
#       next primary prompt.

FIGNORE=.class
#       A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when  per-
#       forming filename completion. A filename whose suffix
#       matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from
#       the list of matched filenames.
#       A sample value is ``.o:~''.

HISTIGNORE=ignoredups:ignorespace
#       If set to a value of ignoredups, lines matching the
#       last history line are not entered into history. If
#       set to a value of ignorespace, lines which begin
#       witha <space> are not entered on the history list.
